    <div class="question">
        I have no idea how to start solving this mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You could use a variety of path-finding algorithms for this mission if you wished.
        For this, let's look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">
        Breadth First Search</a>.
        First you form a queue and take the elements from inside it.
        For a graph search we should write down which are the "visited" nodes.

    <div class="question">
        I need some help to proceed with the mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        First we need state representation. Let's use a tuple with coordinates and the path.

<pre class="brush: python">
queue = [((1, 1), "")] # we will use list for simplicity
visited = set()
    </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        I am gone half way through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Next look at the queue elements and check if it's a goal.
        If not, add the new nodes in queue. If the node is marked as visited you can pass it.

<pre class="brush: python">
while queue:
    position, path = queue.pop(0)
    if position == (10, 10):
        return path
    if position in visited:
        continue
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Now check all available neighboring cells and add them to the queue.
        We need the positions and directions for these cells.

<pre class="brush: python">
...
    for neigh_position, direction in get_neighbours(maze, positions):
        if neigh_position in visited:
            continue
        queue.append(neigh_position, path + direction)
</pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I tried all I could. Nothing works. SOS
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If you solved the "Moore Neighborhood" mission,
        then you can write a similar "get_neighbours" function. Don't forget to get the directions.
